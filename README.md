# OCR Simple Example 
This is a tiny example of an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool using [Tesseract](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js) which is a Javascript port of the [Tesseract OCR engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). 
Just upload a text image and wait for the recognition operation.
